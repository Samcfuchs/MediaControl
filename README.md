# Media Control

An implementation to control the Music Player Daemon on a Debian system.

This project aims to allow you to control a MPD server over bluetooth with a
controller. It aims to be an intuitive interface, with limited scope to make it
easy to use. A graphical interface is not planned, but once this is done, I may
choose to make one and expand the capabilities of the implementation.

**If there is a mode button on your controller, make sure that it is off.**

### Buttons

### TODO
* Look into XBMC/Kodi
* Test controllers
* Get wireless controller
